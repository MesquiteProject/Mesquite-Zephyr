Zephyr

Ubuntu:  RAxML double // in path; but Garli and PAUP are OK
Ubuntu: RAXML dialog too big

- if cancel a zephyr search, make sure to unlock matrix if needed against editing

- when you hit stop button - offer the user the option to display the current tree  (simple version: put tree description in clipboard)  
	(or: establishes a treeblock and adds trees to that block; animate tree block)
- harvest bootstrap trees as it goes, moving it into a treeblock (could then have a live consensus)
- bootstrap run in Garli, display branch lengths as zero - should just do majrule right away.
- Have it so that you can stop the remote process from within Mesquite.

- have the configuration and set up files (e.Â®g., the matrix) saved rather than used to start a remote run




1.01:  
- report version numbers of programs
- icons for external programs




===========

- Parametric bootstrapping!!!

pre-Beta
	better stopping mechanisms
	allow user to choose folder for output files
	current typeset, wtset should probably be stored to temp file for parsimony run with PAUP?
	
	have links to web site of programs in error message and in main dialog boxes
	support for COAL
	support for PHYLIP

	
Possible:
	- have detachable runs
	prominently have helper programs displayed

Eventual:
