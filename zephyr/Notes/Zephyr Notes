Zephyr

Ubuntu:  RAxML double // in path; but Garli and PAUP are OK
Ubuntu: RAXML dialog too big

- protect file paths in the batchfile?  if there is a space in file path
- should show you options (command) that are being sent
- dialog box should show versions it works for

- if cancel a zephyr search, make sure to unlock matrix if needed against editing


- when you hit stop button - offer the user the option to display the current tree  (simple version: put tree description in clipboard)  
	(or: establishes a treeblock and adds trees to that block; animate tree block)
- harvest bootstrap trees as it goes, moving it into a treeblock (could then have a live consensus)
- bootstrap run in Garli, display branch lengths as zero - should just do majrule right away.
- Have it so that you can stop the remote process from within Mesquite.

- have the configuration and set up files (e.g., the matrix) saved rather than used to start a remote run




1.01:  
- report version numbers of programs




===========

- Parametric bootstrapping!!!

First, when choosing "use codon positions" on the "characters models" tab it automatically 
	assumes that a "noncoding" subset exists, which it did not in my case.  
	So, it wrote the config file as if there were four models, despite there only being 3 sets 
	in the charpartition.



pre-Beta
	better stopping mechanisms
	allow user to choose folder for output files
	- from Wayne: don't write taxa that are all missing/gaps
	- put name of matrix in tree block / tree name
	current typeset, wtset should probably be stored to temp file for parsimony run with PAUP?
	
	have links to web site of programs in error message and in main dialog boxes
	support for COAL
	support for PHYLIP

	
Possible:
	- have detachable runs
	prominently have helper programs displayed

Eventual:
	use XML for building GUIs
