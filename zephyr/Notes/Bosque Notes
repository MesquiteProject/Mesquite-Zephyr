Bosque

Gaipya:  beaver

General Acquirer of Inferred Phylogenies 

First, when choosing "use codon positions" on the "characters models" tab it automatically assumes that a "noncoding" subset exists, which it did not in my case.  So, it wrote the config file as if there were four models, despite there only being 3 sets in the charpartition.



pre-Beta
	better stopping mechanisms
	allow user to choose folder for output files
	- from Wayne: don't write taxa that are all missing/gaps
	- put name of matrix in tree block / tree name
	current typeset, wtset should probably be stored to temp file for parsimony run with PAUP?
	
	have links to web site of programs in error message and in main dialog boxes
	support for COAL
	support for PHYLIP

	
Possible:
	- have detachable runs
	prominently have helper programs displayed

Eventual:
